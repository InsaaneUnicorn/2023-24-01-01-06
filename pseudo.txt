aight... so heres my take on the logic

generate a random number using the time as a seed. limit the number based on how many words are available

Input a character, iterate through the chosen word and match chars

check to make sure the letter is or isnt in the selected word

if wrong {
  save the letter and draw stickwaites
}
if right {
  show every matching letter.
}
