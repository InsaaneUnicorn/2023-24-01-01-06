lTODO: 
			Add it to where the user can change the Welcome to hang waites banner. Make the program more user friendly
			REFACTOR our code, and arrays to impliment DMA so that we can save on memory.
 			Add previous letters guessed
			Add Hanging mr.waties w/ the stages (most likely with ascii art)
			Fix the play again (fixed?)
			Make code conventions and all agree
	 		Have the code check for capitals and symbols
	 		if user types google, chrome, sundar replit stops/crashes.
			ask if user wants to solve
	 		add that the user can only input one character at a time (we also gotta start refactoring our code to use String.h)
			Have a menu where you can choose to play the game and add it to where the user can change the wordbank.
			the user says Googhoul they automatically win
      have user select/change the wordbank & antigoogle in menu
			wordBank and antiGoogle should be seperate so that the program checks for them and do the according procedures.
